Quantum Job Tracker
About the Project

This project — built by Hardhik — is a beginner-friendly Quantum Jobs Dashboard on top of IBM Quantum.
The main goal is simple: make it easier for anyone to run, track, and analyze quantum experiments (jobs) in the cloud.

Unlike traditional career job trackers (used for applying to internships/jobs), this Quantum Job Tracker is purely for Quantum Computing experiments. Here, a job means a quantum circuit execution on IBM’s real or simulated backends.

So the mission of this project is:
 To remove the complexity of raw APIs
 To give learners, students, and researchers one clean interface to submit & monitor experiments
 To make quantum computing more accessible and visual

# Key Differences from a “Career Job Tracker”

Career Job Tracker → Tracks job applications, companies, interview status.

Quantum Job Tracker → Tracks quantum circuit executions (jobs) on IBM Quantum computers.

Both use the word job, but the meaning is entirely different here.

 Features & UI Guide
 Dashboard : 

A simple overview of what the app does and how to use it.

Explains why it’s useful: beginner-friendly, good for teaching, keeps experiments organized.

 Submit Experiment : 

Run famous quantum circuits like Bell state or GHZ state with one click.

Choose your backend (simulator or real IBM quantum machine).

No need to write code every time — just pick and run.

 Jobs :

See a live list of all submitted jobs.

Track job status: pending, running, or finished.

Helps manage multiple experiments in one place.

 Results :

View measurement outcomes after the job finishes.

Get probabilities of quantum states.

Visual charts (histograms) to interpret the quantum experiment clearly.

 Controls (Sidebar) :

Navigation Panel → Move between Dashboard, Submit, Jobs, Results.

Backend Selector → Pick the quantum computer/simulator (ibm_torino, etc.).

⚡ Why is this Useful?

 Removes the hassle of IBM’s raw API

 Perfect for teaching & learning quantum basics

 Tracks experiments over time in one neat interface

 Beginner-friendly design so anyone can start experimenting

 Tech Stack

Frontend & UI → Streamlit

Quantum Backend → IBM Quantum

Language → Python
